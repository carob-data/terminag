# terminag

This is a community standard that provides a vocabulary for agricultural research data. There are two sections.

- "variables" defines variable names and units, and, for numeric variables, a miniumum and maximum accepted value.
- "values" defines accepted values for some character variables. For example, country and crop names.

This standard is under development. It is currently used in the [Carob](https://github.com/reagro/carob) project.
